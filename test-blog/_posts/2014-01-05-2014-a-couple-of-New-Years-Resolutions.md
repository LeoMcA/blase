It's January, and that means only one thing: it's time for making New Year's Resolutions which one will have almost certainly broken in a few weeks!

## Resolution 1: write (at least) one post every week

Having a blog is all well and good, but if you never post on it, there's not much point to it.

Last year, despite having much to write about on issues I deeply care about (*cough* *cough* indiscriminate wiretapping by GCHQ and its friends *cough* *cough*), I only managed to write **one** post.

Yes. One.

This year, I'm aiming for a whole lot more (at least 51 more, in fact).

## Resolution 2: write some code every day

2013 was a dark year for my programming abilities. If anything, they declined as my workload at school increased (particularly when taking my GCSEs). (I'm sure it doesn't need to be said, but) this isn't good.

While school is very important to me, so is programming. It's where I want to go in life, and it's something I greatly enjoy.

I'm going to ensure I code everyday by committing to GitHub every day, which will appear on [my profile](https://github.com/LeoMcA). While the contributions box isn't a perfect measure of if I've coded that day (GitHub also counts pull requests and issues as contribution, and just because I've written code doesn't necessarily mean I'll have committed), it's good enough.

Sharp minds will notice we're already the 5th day into 2014, and might wonder what I've been working on so far.

It's a simple game, built using the [CraftyJS game framework](http://craftyjs.com/), I've called 'Jumpy' (because I'm not very good at naming things). If you're desperate to play a game which is still very much a work in progress, feel free to find it [here](http://leomca.github.io/jumpy).

## How long will I last?

Not very long, and in all probability, I will have failed before the end of the month.

My first target is making it past (the so-called) 'Fail Friday', Friday 24 January, where it's predicted the UK's collective willpower will run dry.
